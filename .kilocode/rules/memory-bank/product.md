# Product Vision

## What is alex-treBENCH?

alex-treBENCH is a comprehensive benchmarking system that evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) using historical Jeopardy questions. It provides a standardized, entertaining, and statistically rigorous way to measure and compare AI model performance across diverse knowledge domains.

## Why Does It Exist?

### Problems It Solves

1. **Lack of Standardized LLM Benchmarking**: Most benchmarks are either too academic or too narrow. Jeopardy questions provide a balanced mix of general knowledge, wordplay, and reasoning challenges.

2. **Difficulty Comparing Models**: With dozens of LLMs available through OpenRouter, users need a systematic way to compare their capabilities, costs, and performance characteristics.

3. **Cost-Performance Analysis**: Users need to understand the trade-offs between model accuracy, response time, and API costs to make informed decisions.

4. **Domain-Specific Evaluation**: Different models excel in different areas. This system reveals which models perform best in specific categories like Science, History, or Literature.

## How It Works

### Core Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**: Downloads and processes Jeopardy questions from Kaggle dataset
2. **Statistical Sampling**: Selects representative questions using stratified sampling
3. **Model Querying**: Sends questions to multiple LLMs via OpenRouter API
4. **Answer Evaluation**: Uses fuzzy matching to grade responses in Jeopardy format
5. **Metrics Calculation**: Computes accuracy, speed, cost, and consistency metrics
6. **Report Generation**: Creates detailed performance reports and comparisons

### Key Features

- **Multi-Model Support**: Test 20+ models simultaneously through OpenRouter
- **Flexible Grading**: Supports strict, lenient, and Jeopardy-style answer formats
- **Statistical Rigor**: 95% confidence level with proper sampling methodology
