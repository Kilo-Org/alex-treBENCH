# Current Context

## Project Status

- **Phase**: Early development - Core implementation complete
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Last Updated**: August 2025
- **Environment**: Development/Testing

## Current State

### Working Components

- CLI interface complete with all major commands implemented
- Database layer (SQLAlchemy) operational with SQLite support
- Dynamic model system operational supporting 323+ models from OpenRouter
- Three-tier fallback system (API → Cache → Static) implemented
- Comprehensive test suite with smoke tests and test agents (96% success rate)
- Documentation complete (README, Technical Spec, User Guide, API Reference)
- Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
- Configuration management with YAML and environment variables
- Session management for pause/resume functionality implemented

### Recently Addressed

- **Dynamic Model System**: Complete replacement of hardcoded models with OpenRouter API integration
  - Support for 323+ models instead of ~20 hardcoded ones
  - Default model changed to Claude 3.5 Sonnet (anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)
  - Three-tier fallback system: API → Cache → Static backup
  - New CLI commands: `models refresh`, `models search`, `models info`, `models cache`
- Backward compatibility aliases added in `src/storage/models.py`:
  - `Benchmark = BenchmarkRun`
  - `BenchmarkQuestion = Question`
  - `ModelResponse = BenchmarkResult`
  - `ModelPerformanceSummary = ModelPerformance`

### Known Issues

- Repository layer inconsistencies:
  - Some methods in `src/storage/repositories.py` may still reference old model names directly
  - `QuestionRepository.get_benchmark_questions()` method needs fixing (line 337)
- Session management could be improved for better error recovery
- Some imports in test files may need updating

## Recent Work

- **Dynamic Model System Implementation**:
  - Implemented `src/models/model_cache.py` for intelligent caching
  - Enhanced `src/models/model_registry.py` with dynamic fetching capabilities
  - Updated `src/models/openrouter.py` with improved API integration
  - Added comprehensive CLI commands for model management
- Implemented complete CLI with Click framework
- Added session management for pause/resume functionality
- Created comprehensive smoke test and test agents
- Set up Docker containerization
- Implemented statistical sampling and fuzzy matching algorithms
- Built reporting system with multiple output formats
- Added support for multiple benchmark modes (quick, standard, comprehensive)
- Added backward compatibility aliases for model names

## Active Components

- **Data Pipeline**: Kaggle dataset ingestion and preprocessing ready
- **Dynamic Model System**: Real-time model fetching with caching and fallbacks operational
- **Benchmark Runner**: Async execution with progress tracking implemented
- **Evaluation System**: Fuzzy matching with multiple grading modes complete
- **Metrics Calculator**: Comprehensive performance analysis ready
- **Storage Layer**: SQLAlchemy ORM with migration support (mostly working)
- **Session Management**: Pause/resume functionality for long-running benchmarks

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining repository issues:
   - Update `QuestionRepository.get_benchmark_questions()` to use correct model
   - Verify all repository methods use correct model names
2. Initialize Jeopardy dataset from Kaggle
3. Run first benchmark tests with real data and new dynamic model system
4. Test session management with real benchmarks using multiple models
5. Optimize performance for large-scale benchmarks with 323+ model support
6. Consider adding web interface (FastAPI) with model selection capabilities

## Configuration Notes

- Requires OpenRouter API key in environment (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`)
- Default model: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)
- Model cache stored in `data/cache/models.json` with 24-hour TTL
- Default database: SQLite (can upgrade to PostgreSQL)
- Supports Docker deployment with docker-compose
- Uses YAML configuration with environment overrides
- Test database uses temporary SQLite files

## Testing Status

- Dynamic model system tests: 96% success rate with comprehensive coverage
- Smoke test (`scripts/smoke_test.py`): Implemented with simulation mode
- Test agents (`scripts/test_agents.py`): Multiple agents for different components
- Model-specific test script (`scripts/test_dynamic_models.py`): Validates dynamic fetching
- Quick test script (`scripts/quick_test.sh`): Available for rapid testing
- Integration tests: Ready to run after minor repository fixes
