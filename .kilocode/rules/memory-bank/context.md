# Current Context

## Project Status

- **Phase**: Early alpha software
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Last Updated**: August 2025
- **Environment**: Development/Testing

## Current State

- Core benchmarking system not functioning
- CLI interface complete with all major commands
- Database layer (SQLAlchemy) operational with SQLite support
- Database layer issue with SQLAlchemy session management across the codebase
- Database layer issue with missing question_count attribute reference
- OpenRouter API integration functional for 20+ models
- Comprehensive test suite with 80%+ coverage target
- Documentation complete (README, Technical Spec, User Guide, API Reference)

## Recent Work

- Completed implementation of all core modules
- Set up Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
- Implemented comprehensive error handling and logging
- Created statistical sampling and fuzzy matching algorithms
- Built reporting system with multiple output formats

## Active Components

- **Data Pipeline**: Kaggle dataset ingestion and preprocessing
- **Benchmark Runner**: Async execution with progress tracking
- **Evaluation System**: Fuzzy matching with multiple grading modes
- **Metrics Calculator**: Comprehensive performance analysis
- **Storage Layer**: SQLAlchemy ORM with migration support

## Next Steps

1. Initialize Jeopardy dataset from Kaggle
2. Run first benchmark tests with real data
3. Optimize performance for large-scale benchmarks
4. Consider adding web interface (FastAPI)
5. Enhance analytics and visualization capabilities

## Known Issues

- Dataset needs to be initialized before first use
- Some models may have different response formats requiring adaptation
- Rate limiting needs fine-tuning for different API providers

## Configuration Notes

- Requires OpenRouter API key in environment
- Default database: SQLite (can upgrade to PostgreSQL)
- Supports Docker deployment with docker-compose
- Uses YAML configuration with environment overrides
