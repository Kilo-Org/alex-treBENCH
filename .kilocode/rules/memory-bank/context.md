# Current Context

## Project Status

- **Phase**: Early development - Core implementation complete
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Last Updated**: August 2025
- **Environment**: Development/Testing

## Current State

### Working Components

- CLI interface complete with all major commands implemented
- Database layer (SQLAlchemy) operational with SQLite support
- OpenRouter API integration functional for 20+ models
- Comprehensive test suite with smoke tests and test agents
- Documentation complete (README, Technical Spec, User Guide, API Reference)
- Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
- Configuration management with YAML and environment variables
- Session management for pause/resume functionality implemented

### Recently Addressed

- Backward compatibility aliases added in `src/storage/models.py`:
  - `Benchmark = BenchmarkRun`
  - `BenchmarkQuestion = Question`
  - `ModelResponse = BenchmarkResult`
  - `ModelPerformanceSummary = ModelPerformance`

### Known Issues

- Repository layer inconsistencies:
  - Some methods in `src/storage/repositories.py` may still reference old model names directly
  - `QuestionRepository.get_benchmark_questions()` method needs fixing (line 337)
- Session management could be improved for better error recovery
- Some imports in test files may need updating

## Recent Work

- Implemented complete CLI with Click framework
- Added session management for pause/resume functionality
- Created comprehensive smoke test and test agents
- Set up Docker containerization
- Implemented statistical sampling and fuzzy matching algorithms
- Built reporting system with multiple output formats
- Added support for multiple benchmark modes (quick, standard, comprehensive)
- Added backward compatibility aliases for model names

## Active Components

- **Data Pipeline**: Kaggle dataset ingestion and preprocessing ready
- **Benchmark Runner**: Async execution with progress tracking implemented
- **Evaluation System**: Fuzzy matching with multiple grading modes complete
- **Metrics Calculator**: Comprehensive performance analysis ready
- **Storage Layer**: SQLAlchemy ORM with migration support (mostly working)
- **Session Management**: Pause/resume functionality for long-running benchmarks

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining repository issues:
   - Update `QuestionRepository.get_benchmark_questions()` to use correct model
   - Verify all repository methods use correct model names
2. Initialize Jeopardy dataset from Kaggle
3. Run first benchmark tests with real data
4. Test session management with real benchmarks
5. Optimize performance for large-scale benchmarks
6. Consider adding web interface (FastAPI)

## Configuration Notes

- Requires OpenRouter API key in environment (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`)
- Default database: SQLite (can upgrade to PostgreSQL)
- Supports Docker deployment with docker-compose
- Uses YAML configuration with environment overrides
- Test database uses temporary SQLite files

## Testing Status

- Smoke test (`scripts/smoke_test.py`): Implemented with simulation mode
- Test agents (`scripts/test_agents.py`): Multiple agents for different components
- Quick test script (`scripts/quick_test.sh`): Available for rapid testing
- Integration tests: Ready to run after minor repository fixes
